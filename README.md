# GENESIS MANDELA - IBAT PROJECT
/* ======= Hey! I'm Mandela Samboy and I am designer, developer and photographer. ======= */
/* ======= Currently located in Dublin I am looking to master my developer skills. ======= */

==== PROJECT DESCRIPTION 🖥️ ====

Repository created to show my knowledge and skills creating Responsive WebsiteS using HTML and CSS, in this case with the help of the pre-processor SASS which makes work easy and fast. 

Performed a small library with reusable classes and styles that can be used throught the project.

In this project I showed that my basic HTML and CSS skills are pretty good to create clean, understandable, and reusable code in a small project without the help of external libraries or frameworks.

Used some Javascript code to make the site quite interactive showing basic knowledge about the language.

--> The project is divided in five main pages;

    1. HOME LANDING PAGE 🏠

    2. SMOOTH SMOOTHIES 🍹

    3. SOFTWARE ANALYTICS 📉

    4. TRAVEL AGENCY ✈️

    5. WEB DESIGN 💻

--> My personal review;

    Being my second small project that contains few pages, this time thanks to SASS the develop of the site has been not easier but more organized. SASS allowed me to create a small library with components that I have been using through the project, but changing few details for each page. 

    Being a project where the pages are not from the same topic, I needed to change typography, sizes, font-family, padding, margin or other styles for each element in each page.

    But this allowed me to understand that having a big project that can be unique, this will allow to fast the development of the site. The use of @mixins, @include, @extend and variables make everything much easier, and I am waiting for my next project to develop this skills much more.

    I believe that my organization is really clean and is easy to navigate through folders, files and code.

    Considering that I have been lot of time with these project, and think that my knowledge here is not increasing how it would be, I decided to leave it how is it now to start new projects and grow more as Developer. Going more into Javascript basics, and libraries that will help me to create more stunning sites.
